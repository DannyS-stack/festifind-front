# Festifind, never lose your friends again!

Festifind solves the age old problem of losing your friends on festivals. There are no festivals right now you say? Well it works just as well to track just about anybody who is using the app. With this app, you will never lose the people you care about. This app features a map with markers on the locations where other users are and they are displayed with a name, so you always know who exactly is where!

# Goals for this project

As mentioned, I dedcided the experiment with a lot of new technologies. I thought both react-Native and Graphql where super interesting and this was a good opportunity to try. It defintiely made the project more challenging as this was also the first full-stack app I have ever build from scratch. The goals for when I was done where:

- know how to use graphql
- know how to make a mobile app with React native
