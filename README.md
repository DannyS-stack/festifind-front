# Festifind, never lose your friends again!

Festifind solves the age old problem of losing your friends on festivals. There are no festivals right now you say? Well it works just as well to track just about anybody who is using the app. With this app, you will never lose the people you care about. This app features a map with markers on the locations where other users are and they are displayed with a name, so you always know who exactly is where!

# App demo
![festifind-example](https://github.com/DannyS-stack/festifind-front/blob/development/Images/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif)


for this project I decided to experiment with a lot of technologies that were new to me, I've tagged those with > new

# Used technologies
- Javascript
- React Native > new
- Graphql > new
- Sequelize
- Redux
- Apollo Client > new
- Apollo Server-Express > new

# Goals for this project
As mentioned, I decided the experiment with a lot of new technologies. I thought both react-Native and Graphql where super interesting and this was a good opportunity to try. It definitely made the project more challenging as this was also the first full-stack app I have ever build from scratch. The goals for when I was done where:

- know how to use graphql
- know how to make a mobile app with React native
- practice setting up a database and using sequelize
- Learn how to use Apollo-Client and Apollo-Server
- build a full-stack app from scratch
- using .env files to hide sensitive information
- being able to use git version control


# user stories
- As a user I want to be able to see the groups that I am in
- As a user I want to be able to login 
- As a user I want to be able to see who is in my group
- As a user I want to be able to Sign up 
- As a user I want to be able to be the owner of a group
- As a user I want to be able to create a new group
- As a user I want to be able to add people to my group
- As a group owner I want to be able to  remove people from my group
- As a user I want to be able to login and see my own location on the map
- as a user I want to share my location in real time

#  Reflection
So this was the first time I really built a full stack app from scratch. I built this app with only 3 months of coding experience so it was very challenging, but I managed to do it in the end. The app is still very much a work in progress, the app in its current state is only 10 days of work and is missing some features that I still want to work on. I think I made it even more challenging for myself by using react native and graphql for the first time, but I did learn a lot more than if I would have played it safe and just only did things I already knew. I really liked working with graphql once I started to understand it and react native is also really cool when you get used to it. Would definitely use them again in future projects.
